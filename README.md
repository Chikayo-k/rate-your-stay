# Rate Your Stay

This is the fourth project in the code institute diploma in full stack software development. It is a full stack website designed for travellers to visit where they can provide travel reviews for people who are thinking about travelling and also people who want to to just browse what the site has to offer. The backend of the project was built using Django, Python and a Postgres relational database to store the site's data. The project is deployed using Heroku. The project was managed using githubs built in boards so I could create Sprints to track the Epics and user stories.

## Project Goals

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an interactive space where travellers from all over the world can share their travel experiences, tips, and guides. The website should provide users with a simple user interface. A good understanding of what the site provides and what it offers.

### Target Audience

- People who travel a lot and enjoy sharing their experiences.
- People who are planning to travel and want to get a feel for the places they are going.

### User Goals

- As a site user I want to explore holiday ideas and also want to know other people's opinions.

- As a site user I want to be able to create an account so I can login and add reviews of places I have visited. I want to have control over the reviews I create and be able to make changes or delete them if I want. I want to be able to access the site's socials so I can share my reviews with family and friends not using the site. I want to be able to view reviews left by other people.

- As a site user who does not have an account I want to be able to view the articles on the site and read reviews that have been left by people that can help me plan a trip.

- As a site user I want to be able to log out of the website and keep my details safe and secure.

### Site owner goals

- As a site owner I want to offer a platform that will connect people and let them share their reviews on locations they have visited.
- As a site owner I want to grow the site by using social media to share details.
